## Q1: How does the web work?
1 You search something on google 
2 DNS changes name to IP 
3 IP travel to local cell tower in packets form in sequence
4 Then packet in form of light through optical fibre cables to datacentres
5 Datacentres fetch the data and respond back to same route


## Q2: What are ports?
Ports are the just like the addresses of your home, 16 bit unsigned integer used by applications or services to receive or send data. 

## Q3: Frontend vs Backend
**Frontend:** UI of app/website, navigation, html, css, js
**Backend:** database management, seamless and secure to support frontend, python, java, MongoDB, MySQL

## Q4: What are dependencies?
An necessity requirement by application to increase reusabilty of codes and build easily. Flask provides extra librariries for web building and API calls which python can't do slone

## Q5: What does a web server do?
Web server takes a client request and sends it back using HTTP protocol and web server consists of a hardware along with database which stores websites files which delivers them over the internet.

## Q6: Why do applications need databases?
To store data because if an application dosesn't have database all its data will be lost if it's shutdown/restart.
Ex- user data, cache memory, login credentials etc.

## Q7: How does Python know what to install?
Requirement.txt is a file with all the dependencies and libraries used by python, user needs to install the requirements by pip install -r -y requirements.txt, which is already shared with project.

## Q8: Common tools explained
**Flask:** framework of python used web dev and building api 
**Express:** framework for Nodejs used for web apps, APIs and backend services
**PostgreSQL:** a SQL based open-source dbms.
**MongoDB:** A NoSQL database which stores data in JSON like format.

## Things I'm still confused about:
Libraries, dependencies

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
**Claude's Feedback:** Ready for Week 1
**Key Learnings:** 
- Libraries = pre-written code collections
- Dependencies = libraries your app needs
- Both terms refer to the same thing from different angles
